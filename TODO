Permalinks
----------

Currently, the URLs for the list of reps looks something like:

  /lookup/?lnglat=-76.613516%2C39.279196&address=28+E+Henrietta+St%2C+Baltimore%2C+MD+21230%2C+USA

The 'address' query param is from the geocoding service, representing a
"pretty" formatted version of the street address the user typed in. (This
param is null if the user chose to look up representation from geolocation
and it couldn't be reversed-geocoded to a single street address.)  It's
sloppy to pass the address this way, since it can be tampered with. (It's
escaped in the template so there's no risk of dangerous output, but it's
still subject to being modified out of band.) One better way to provide
the nice formatted address would be to store it as a session variable for
one-time display on the results page (i.e., deleted from the session after
rendering the template).

That leaves the 'lnglat' param. We should convert it to a geohash for use in
nice URLs, in this case for example:

  39.279196, -76.613516 -> dqcx2we9zsvfv

(The geohash algorithm uses lat/lng ordering.)

So the final clean, permalinkable URL for a YourReps result page could look
like:

  /r/dqcx2we9zsvfv/

(The /r part of the path being an arbitrary token for unambiguously matching
through regexes URL patterns to the results page view, since geohashes are
base-32-encoded and therefore simple pattens like \w+ could match too much.)
